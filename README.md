# DL_Style_Extraction
Separating and extracting the content and style of an image using CNNs. Based off A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style by L. Gatys

To run make sure all import libraries are available/pip installed or set up an appropriate python virtual environment. 

The true image path can be specified at runtime with the --impath flag
Style or content extraction can be specified using the --optye flag as either --optyple style or --optype content

Content extractions take approximately 15 minutes to run, and style extractions approximately 1 minute.
